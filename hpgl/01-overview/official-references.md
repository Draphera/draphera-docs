# Official References

**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** YYYY‑MM‑DD  

This document lists the official, historical, and technical references used in the development of the **Draphera HP‑GL/HP‑GL/2 Bible**.  
Because HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 were never standardized through a formal body (such as ISO or W3C), the available sources are fragmented, vendor‑specific, and often incomplete.  
The references below represent the most authoritative material currently accessible.

# 1. Hewlett‑Packard Documentation

These documents form the primary historical foundation for HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2.  
They include original manuals, command references, and device specifications published by Hewlett‑Packard.

### 1.1 HP‑GL
- HP 7470A/7475A Plotter User’s Guide  
- HP 7580/7585/7595 Drafting Plotter Technical Reference  
- HP Graphics Language (HP‑GL) Reference Manual  
- HP Pen Plotter Command Summary Sheets  

### 1.2 HP‑GL/2
- HP‑GL/2 and PJL Technical Reference Manual  
- HP DesignJet Series Technical Documentation  
- HP‑GL/2 Command Reference (various plotter models)  
- HP‑GL/2 Raster and Text Extensions Documentation  

### 1.3 Device‑Specific Manuals
These manuals contain variations, undocumented behaviours, and clarifications:
- HP DraftPro Series  
- HP DraftMaster Series  
- HP DesignJet 600/700/1000 Series  
- HP ColorPro and related models

# 2. Vendor and Industry Documentation

The apparel industry adopted HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 informally.  
The following sources provide insight into vendor‑specific dialects and behaviours.

### 2.1 CAD/CAM Vendors
- Gerber Technology Plotter and Digitizer Manuals  
- Lectra Systemes Plotter Documentation  
- Investronica Plotter Command Guides  
- Optitex Plotter Output Specifications  
- Tukatech Plotter and Marker Documentation  
- Assyst Bullmer Plotter Manuals  

### 2.2 Plotter Manufacturers (Non‑HP)
- Graphtec Technical Manuals  
- Mutoh Plotter Command References  
- Ioline Plotter Documentation  
- Roland DG Technical Notes  

These documents often include HP‑GL/HP‑GL/2 compatibility notes, deviations, and proprietary extensions.

# 3. Academic and Technical References

Although limited, some academic and technical publications discuss vector plotting, coordinate systems, and legacy graphics languages.

### 3.1 Vector Graphics and Plotting
- Research papers on vector rendering and pen‑plotter simulation  
- Technical notes on coordinate transformations and scaling  
- Publications on legacy CAD formats and interoperability  

### 3.2 Apparel Technology
- Studies on marker efficiency and plotting workflows  
- Documentation on CAD interoperability challenges  
- Historical analyses of apparel CAD/CAM evolution

# 4. Open‑Source and Community Resources

Community‑driven projects have contributed significantly to the preservation and understanding of HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2.

### 4.1 Open‑Source Implementations
- HP‑GL/2 parsers and renderers in open repositories  
- Pen‑plotter simulation tools  
- Reverse‑engineered command lists and behaviour notes  

### 4.2 Archival Efforts
- Digitized manuals and technical sheets  
- Community‑maintained documentation repositories  
- Collections of legacy plotter files used for testing  

These sources help fill gaps left by incomplete or unavailable official documentation.

# 5. Methodological References

The Draphera Bible also draws on established practices for writing technical standards.

### 5.1 Standards Methodology
- ISO/IEC guidelines for technical specifications  
- W3C specification writing practices  
- ECMA documentation structures  
- RFC (Request for Comments) formatting conventions  

### 5.2 Testing and Conformance
- Principles of conformance testing  
- Interoperability test design methodologies  
- Validation and normalization frameworks

# 6. Notes on Source Reliability

Because HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 evolved over decades and across many devices:

- some sources conflict with each other  
- some behaviours are undocumented or device‑specific  
- vendor manuals may contain errors or omissions  
- community sources vary in accuracy  

The Draphera Bible cross‑references multiple sources to ensure the most accurate interpretation possible.

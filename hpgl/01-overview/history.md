# History

**Document Version:** 1.0.0

This document provides a historical overview of HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2, their evolution, and their adoption within the apparel industry.  
Understanding this history is essential to contextualize the need for a unified and interoperable specification.

# 1. Origins of HP‑GL (1970s–1980s)

HP‑GL (Hewlett‑Packard Graphics Language) was introduced in the late 1970s as a command language for pen plotters.  
Its design goals were simplicity, device independence, and compactness.

Key characteristics:
- ASCII‑based command language  
- Coordinate‑driven vector plotting  
- Minimal instruction set  
- Designed for engineering, CAD, and general plotting  

HP‑GL quickly became a de facto standard due to the widespread adoption of HP plotters across technical fields.

# 2. Emergence of HP‑GL/2 (1980s–1990s)

As plotting needs evolved, HP introduced **HP‑GL/2**, an enhanced and more structured version of the language.

Major improvements:
- Higher precision  
- Binary data support  
- Better curve handling  
- Enhanced text capabilities  
- More consistent device control  

HP‑GL/2 was not designed as a replacement but as an evolution.  
As a result, both languages coexisted, often within the same devices.

# 3. Adoption in the Apparel Industry

During the 1980s and 1990s, apparel CAD/CAM vendors adopted HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 as output formats for:

- pattern plotting  
- marker printing  
- grading visualization  
- technical drawings  

Reasons for adoption:
- HP plotters were widely available  
- The language was simple to generate  
- Vendors could extend or modify commands as needed  
- No licensing barriers  

However, this flexibility led to fragmentation.

# 4. Fragmentation and Vendor Dialects

Because HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 were not formally standardized for apparel use, vendors introduced:

- custom commands  
- undocumented behaviours  
- device‑specific tolerances  
- proprietary extensions  
- inconsistent coordinate systems  

This resulted in:
- incompatibility between CAD systems  
- unpredictable rendering across plotters  
- reliance on technician experience rather than documentation  
- difficulty in debugging and converting files  

The apparel industry never established a unified standard to address these issues.

---

# 5. Loss of Institutional Knowledge

Over time:
- original HP documentation became harder to access  
- legacy plotters were discontinued  
- vendor‑specific knowledge remained internal and undocumented  
- technicians relied on trial‑and‑error rather than formal specifications  

As a result, HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 became “living fossils”: widely used but poorly understood.

---

# 6. The Need for a Unified Specification

Despite their age, HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 remain the backbone of apparel plotting workflows.  
Yet no document has ever:

- consolidated HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2  
- documented their differences  
- defined an apparel‑safe subset  
- established interoperability rules  
- provided a modern, authoritative reference  

This gap has persisted for more than 40 years.

# 7. The Draphera Initiative

The **Draphera HP‑GL/HP‑GL/2 Bible** is the first attempt to:

- unify historical documentation  
- formalize the languages for apparel use  
- define a deterministic, interoperable standard  
- provide a complete test suite  
- preserve technical knowledge for future generations  

This project aims to transform decades of fragmented, vendor‑specific practices into a coherent and open technical foundation.

# 8. Future Historical Additions

This document will expand as new archival material, device manuals, and community contributions become available.  
Contributions are welcome through the Draphera documentation process.

# Acknowledgements

The development of the **Draphera HP‑GL/HP‑GL/2 Bible** has been made possible thanks to the collective effort of professionals, researchers, engineers, and pattern‑making experts who have contributed—directly or indirectly—to the understanding of these languages over the past decades.

Although HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 were never formally standardized for the apparel industry, a vast ecosystem of knowledge has emerged through documentation, reverse engineering, and practical experience. This project stands on the shoulders of that history.

## Historical Contributors
We acknowledge the foundational work of:
- Early Hewlett‑Packard engineers who designed HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2  
- Technical writers who produced the original plotter manuals  
- Developers who maintained compatibility across generations of devices  
- Researchers who documented undocumented behaviours and edge cases  

Their contributions form the technical backbone upon which this Bible is built.

## Industry Contributors
The apparel industry has played a crucial role in shaping the practical use of HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2. We acknowledge:
- CAD/CAM vendors who adopted and extended the languages  
- Plotter manufacturers who implemented custom dialects  
- Technicians and pattern makers who ensured real‑world operability  
- Training institutions that preserved operational knowledge  

Their day‑to‑day experience has revealed the gaps, inconsistencies, and ambiguities that this document aims to clarify.

## Community and Open‑Knowledge Contributors
This project benefits from:
- Open‑source communities focused on vector formats and plotting  
- Developers who shared insights, test files, and reverse‑engineered behaviours  
- Archivists who preserved legacy documentation and device manuals  

Their openness has enabled a more complete and accurate reconstruction of the languages.

## Draphera Contributors
The Draphera team has consolidated, verified, and unified decades of fragmented knowledge into a coherent, interoperable standard. Contributions include:
- Technical analysis and reverse engineering  
- Formal specification design  
- Normalization and interoperability rules  
- Test suite development  
- Documentation and editorial work  

This Bible reflects Draphera’s commitment to transparency, reproducibility, and long‑term preservation of technical knowledge.

## Acknowledgement of Limitations
Despite extensive research, some behaviours of legacy devices remain undocumented or inconsistent.  
The Draphera Bible will continue to evolve as new information emerges, and contributions from the community are welcomed.

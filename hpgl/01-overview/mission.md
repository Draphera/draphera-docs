# Mission

**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28

The mission of the **Draphera HP‑GL/HP‑GL/2 Bible** is to provide the first unified, authoritative, and apparel‑oriented specification for HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2.  
For more than four decades, these languages have been essential to pattern plotting and marker production, yet no comprehensive or interoperable reference has ever existed.  
This document aims to change that.

## 1. Establish a Unified Technical Standard
The Draphera Bible consolidates historical documentation, vendor practices, and real‑world device behaviour into a single, coherent reference.  
Its goal is to eliminate ambiguity, reduce fragmentation, and provide a stable foundation for long‑term interoperability.

---

## 2. Preserve and Clarify Legacy Knowledge
Much of the practical understanding of HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 has been preserved informally through technician experience and vendor‑specific manuals.  
This project seeks to document, formalize, and safeguard that knowledge for future generations.

---

## 3. Define an Apparel‑Safe Subset
The apparel industry requires predictable, deterministic behaviour for plotting patterns, markers, and grading.  
The Draphera Bible introduces the first **apparel‑safe subset**, a curated collection of commands and rules designed to ensure:

- reproducibility  
- device independence  
- compatibility across vendors  
- safe and consistent rendering  

---

## 4. Enable Reliable Interoperability
By documenting differences between HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 and establishing normalization rules, the Draphera Bible provides a framework for:

- conversion tools  
- rendering engines  
- CAD/CAM integrations  
- validation and debugging workflows  

This ensures that files behave consistently across devices, software, and generations of technology.

---

## 5. Support Education and Industry Training
The document is designed to serve as a reference for:

- technical schools  
- training programs  
- CAD/CAM educators  
- new technicians entering the field  

Its structure and clarity aim to make HP‑GL and HP‑GL/2 accessible and teachable.

---

## 6. Promote Transparency and Open Knowledge
The Draphera Bible is developed as an open, publicly accessible resource.  
Its mission includes fostering collaboration, encouraging contributions, and ensuring that the specification remains transparent and community‑driven.

---

## 7. Provide a Foundation for Future Standards
Beyond documenting legacy languages, the Draphera Bible lays the groundwork for:

- modern interoperability standards  
- the Draphera Unified Plot Format (DUPF)  
- future extensions and device‑agnostic workflows  

Its mission is not only to preserve the past, but to enable the next generation of apparel‑focused plotting technologies.
